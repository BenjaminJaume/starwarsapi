# Star Wars API

I created it while following the corresponding course on Udemy: [The Complete Web Developer in 2020: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/)


## What it does

This is a single page application that fetch information from a [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/) and display it nicely on the Front End.

## What tools I've used

The app bootstrapped with __create-react-app__.

## Conclusion

It was a simple exercise from the course to introduce me to React and a public API.
